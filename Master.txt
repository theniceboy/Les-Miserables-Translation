1815年 
土伦监狱
Prologue - Chain Gang
低头吧，低头吧，避开他们的眼睛吧
Look down, look down. Don't look 'em in the eye.
低头吧，低头吧，你将永无出头之日
Look down, look down. You're here until you die.
烈日炎炎，好像地狱之火
The sun is strong. It's hot as hell below!
低头吧，低头吧，还有二十年要煎熬
Look down, look down. There's 20 years to go.
我本无过任何错，基督啊，请听听我的祈祷吧
I've done no wrong! Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer!
低头吧，低头吧，你的基督根本不会在意
Look down, look down. Sweet Jesus doesn't care.
我知道她会等我的，我知道她会忠贞不渝
I know she'll wait. I know that she'll be true.
低头吧，低头吧，他们早就将你忘记
Look down, look down. They've all forgotten you.
一旦我自由，就别想再见到我
When I get free, you won't see me
在此化作尘土
here for dust!
低头吧，低头吧，避开他们的眼睛吧
Look down, look down. Don't look 'em in the eye.
主啊，您在让我死前，我还要煎熬多久？
How long, dear Lord, before you let me die?
低头吧，低头吧，你将永世为奴
Look down, look down. You'll always be a slave.
低头头，低头吧，你已踏入你的坟墓
Look down, look down. You're standing in your grave.

沙威冉阿让
给我带24601号犯人
Now bring me prisoner 24601.
你刑期已满，今日假释出狱
Your time is up and your parole's begun.
你知道这是什么意思...
You know what that means...
对！就是说我自由了！
Yes! It means I'm free!
不！这黄票只是放你一马，暂且假释
No! It means you get your yellow ticket of leave
你是个贼      我只偷了一条面包
You are a thief.    I stole a loaf of bread.
你入室抢劫      我只打破了一片玻璃窗
You robbed a house.   I broke a window pane.
我的小外甥命在旦夕，而我们饥饿难忍
My sister's child was close to death and we were starving.
你还会再挨饿的
You will starve again,
除非你牢记法律的意义
unless you learn the meaning of the law.
我早已牢记那19年的意义
I know the meaning of those 19 years
一个法律的奴隶！
A slave of the law!
本是5年刑期
Five years for what you did,
是你试图越狱才被加刑
The rest because you tried to run.
是的， 24601号！
Yes, 24601!
我的名字是冉阿让！
My name is Jean Valjean!
我叫沙威，不要忘记我的名字！
And I'm Javert! Do not forget my name!
别忘了我，24601号！
Do not forget me, 24601!
低头吧，低头吧，你将永世为奴
Look down, look down. You'll always be a slave.
低头吧，低头吧，你已踏入你的坟墓
Look down, look down. You're standing in your grave.

假释
我已重获自由
Freedom is mine,
大地寂静无言
the earth is still.
我能感到微风
I feel the wind
我又能自如呼吸
I breathe again.
看这朗朗乾坤了
And the sky clears

世界正在苏醒
The world is waking.
啜饮这池里的水，多清新甘甜！
Drink from the pool. How clean the taste!
我浪费的这些年华我永远不会忘记！
Never forget the years, the waste!
他们的恶行不可饶恕
Nor forgive them for what they've done
他们才是罪人，每个人都是！
They are the guilty, every one!
新的一天开始了，让我们看看
The day begins and now let's see
这个崭新的世界将如何对我！
What this new world will do for me!

主教
现在我终于知道了自由的感觉
And now I know how freedom feels.
狱卒仿佛随时在你的身边
The jailer always at your heels!
这就是法律！
It is the law!
手里一纸文书
This piece of paper in my hand.
让我随时受着诅咒
It makes me cursed throughout the land.
这就是法律！
It is the law!
我像只过街老鼠
Like a cur I walk the street.
被他们践踏如土
The dirt beneath their feet.

进来吧，先生，看你疲惫不堪
Come in, sir, for you are weary.
现在夜晚外面寒风刺骨
And the night is cold out there.
尽管你我都如此卑微
Though our lives are very humble
我们更该彼此分享扶助
What we have, we have to share.
这里有薄酒，给你暖身
There is wine here to revive you.
这里有面包，给你果腹
There is bread to make you strong.
这里有张床，让你安睡到黎明
There's a bed to rest till morning.
放下痛苦，放下过错
Rest from pain, and rest from wrong.
他让我填饱肚皮，让我大快朵颐
He let me eat my fill I had the lion's share.
手中的银器是我报酬的两倍
The silver in my hand cost twice what I had earned.
整整19年！那是一种绝望的生活！
In all those 19 years! A lifetime of despair!
可他却信任我
And yet he trusted me.
这傻瓜信任我，对我大发慈悲
The old fool trusted me, he'd done his bit of good.
我扮起感激的农奴，对他千恩万谢
I played the grateful serf and thanked him like I should.
可等到夜深人静，我悄悄起身
But when the house was still I got up in the night
偷走银器
Took the silver,
连夜
took my
潜逃
Flight！

当着主教的面，讲讲你的故事！
Tell his reverence your story!
让我们看看他是否还会同情！
Let us see if he's impressed!
昨晚你在这里借宿
You were lodging here last night.
主教好心留你做客
You were the honest bishop's guest.
是发挥基督的大爱，
And then, out of Christian goodness
同情你的遭遇。
when he learned about your plight.
你说银器是他送给你的
You maintain he made a present of this silver.
此话不虚
That is right!
但我的朋友 你走得太匆忙
But my friend, you left so early!
是不是落下了什么
Surely something slipped your mind?
你忘了带走这些 好东西这么能忘了那呢？
You forgot I gave these also. Would you leave the best behind?
警官，请放了他吧
So, messieurs, you may release him,
看在他说的是实话的份上，
for this man has spoken true.
你们可以交差了
I commend you for your duty.
上帝会保佑你的
Now God's blessing go with you.
不过请记住 我的兄弟
But remember this, my brother,
这次的事是个警惕
see in this some higher plan.
你要好好利用这些银器
You must use this precious silver
去做一个诚实的人
to become an honest man.
祈求圣者与你同行
By the witness of the martyrs,
以基督受难之血助你修行
by the passion and the blood,
你的躯体，早被我主带出黑暗
God has raised you out of darkness,
你的灵魂，也早让我托与上帝
I have bought your soul for God!

Valjean's Soliloquy (What Have I Done?) - Valjean 
我做了什么？主啊！我做了什么？ 
What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done?
夜里做贼 成了丧家之犬
Become a thief in the night! Become a dog on the run!
真是自作孽不可活 
And have I fallen so far, and is the hour so late.
心中只剩下仇恨在呐喊
That nothing remains but the cries of my hate?
暗夜中无人听见的嘶吼
The cries in the dark that nobody hears!
陪我站在这命运的转折点?
Here where I stand at the turning of the years?
世上若有光明大道，20年前我就早已已错过
If there's another way to go, I missed it 20 long years ago.

我的人生是一场注定失败的战争
My life was a war that could never be won.
他们扼杀了冉阿让 用号码取而代之
They gave me a number and murdered Valjean.
铁链锁住我 让我等死
When they chained me and left me for dead,
而这当初偷的一口面包
just for stealing a mouthful of bread!
为何让我见到主教
Yet why did I allow this man
让他触动我的灵魂 教我仁爱?
to touch my soul and teach me love?
他将我和别人一视同仁
He treated me like any other.
他信任我 他叫我兄弟
He gave me his trust. He called me brother.
他替主赎下了我的新生
My life he claims for God above.
天下有这么好的事吗?
Can such things be?
我明明已学会仇恨全世界
For I had come to hate the world,
这个一直容不下我的世界
this world that always hated me!
以眼还眼 以牙还牙
Take an eye for an eye!
把自己变成铁石心肠吧！
Turn your heart into stone!
这就是我毕生的信条
This is all I have lived for!
这就是我所知的一切
This is all I have known!
他一句话就可以把我打回监狱
One word from him and I'd be back,
鞭笞折磨 辗转求生
beneath the lash, upon the rack.
可他却给了我自由
Instead he offers me my freedom!
我无地自容 心如刀割
I feel my shame inside me like a knife.
他告诉我 我的灵魂尚在
He told me that I have a soul.
他怎么能这么确定 ?
How does he know?
是什么灵魂在改变我的生命？
What spirit comes to move my life?
难道还有另一条路可走?
Is there another way to go?
我试图寻找，但我失败了
I am reaching, but I fall,
黑夜步步逼近 
and the night is closing in.
我凝视着这虚空
As I stare into the void,
如同我罪孽的漩涡
to the whirlpool of my sin.
我现在要逃离那个世界
I'll escape now from that world,
逃离冉阿让的世界
from the world of Jean Valjean.
冉阿让已经不复存在
Jean Valjean is nothing now!
另一种人生就要展开
Another story must begin!

1823年 滨海蒙特勒伊市
At the End of the Day
在这漫长之日结束是，你又苍老了一点
At the end of the day you're another day older.
这是穷人唯一的生活写照 
And that's all you can say for the life of the poor
这是挣扎 这是战争
It's a struggle! It's a war!
从未有人多给过你什么？
And there's nothing that anyone's giving
又一天忙忙碌碌 到底为什么?
One more day standing about what is it for?
不过是少了一天可活罢了
One day less to be living!
在这长日将近时，你又多了一点苍凉
At the end of the day you're another day colder.
你身上单薄的衣衫抵御不了寒冷
And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill.
所谓的正人君子总是匆匆闪过
And the righteous hurry past,
听不见妇孺 哭泣
they don't hear the little ones crying.
寒冬迅速降临 准备大开杀戒
And the winter is coming on fast, ready to kill.
离死又近了一天
One day nearer to dying!
在这长日将尽时，意味着另一天的开始
At the end of the day there's another day dawning.
朝阳即将升起
And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise!
像沙滩拍碎海浪
And the waves crash on the sand,
像风暴随时会降临
like a storm that'll break any second.
这片土地饥肠辘辘 这笔账还没算清
There's a hunger in the land. There's a reckoning still to be reckoned.
等着吧 终会有报应 总有这么一天
And there's gonna be hell to pay! At the end of the day!
漫漫长日结束 你别想不劳而获
At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing!
好吃懒做换不来面包
Sitting flat on your bum doesn't buy any bread!
家里还有孩子
There are children back at home.
孩子嗷嗷待哺
And the children have got to be fed.
你得庆幸有活可干      有床可睡
And you're lucky to be in a job.        And in a bed!
我们只能自求多福
And we're counting our blessings!
瞧瞧 今天工头多上火呀
Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today?
喘着粗气 动手动脚
With his terrible breath and his wandering hands?
因为小芳汀不肯让他如愿
It's because little Fantine won't give him his way.
看他那裤裆 真是张牙舞爪
Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands!
老板哪里知道 工头总在虎视眈眈
And the boss, he never knows that the foreman is always on heat.
芳汀再不小心 我们走着瞧吧
If Fantine doesn't look out, watch how she goes.
她肯定要流落街头
She'll be out on the street!
漫漫长日结束 又熬过了一天
At the end of the day it's another day over.
赚够了一星期的用度
With enough in your pocket to last for a week.
付给房东 付给商店
Pay the landlord, pay the shop.
拼着这条老命干活
Keep on grafting as long as you're able.
忙忙碌碌直到咽气
Keep on grafting till you drop
不然全家都要饿肚皮
Or it's back to the crumbs off the table.
人总要找活路 漫漫长日结束
Well, you've got to pay your way. At the end of the day!
这是什么呀 纯情小妹妹?
And what have we here little innocent sister?
说呀 芳汀 让大伙听听
Come on, Fantine, let's have all the news!
"亲爱的芳汀 请多寄点钱来"
Dear Fantine, you must send us more money.
"你的孩子病了 慢了就没治喽"
Your child needs a doctor, there's no time to lose.
把信给我 不关你的事
Give that letter to me. It is none of your business.
你一个有夫之妇 还勾搭情人
With a husband at home and a bit on the side!
这里可有人敢向上帝宣誓
Is there anyone here who can swear before God?
她无所畏惧 她无可隐藏?
She has nothing to fear? She has nothing to hide?
你们在吵什么?
What is this fighting all about?
谁把这两人扯开
Will someone tear these two apart?
这里是工厂 可不是马戏团
This is a factory, not a circus.
女士们 冷静下来吧
Now, come on, ladies, settle down!
我这是家正派工厂 我是一市之长
I run a business of repute. I am the mayor of this town.
我希望你处理这场骚乱 尽量耐心点
I look to you to sort this out and be as patient as you can.
谁告诉我是怎么回事
Now someone say how this began!
到头来一看都是她引起的
At the end of the day she's the one who began it!
她在什么小镇藏了个私生子
There's a kid that she's hiding in some little town.
还得给个男人寄钱
There's a man she has to pay.
你猜她去哪挣外块?
You can guess how she picks up the extra?
还不是到处跟人上床
You can bet she's earning her keep sleeping around!
老板可不会喜欢
And the boss wouldn't like it!
对 我的确有个女儿
Yes, it's true. There's a child and the child is my daughter.
她父亲抛弃了我们 我们一无所有
And her father abandoned us leaving us flat.
如今她寄养在一个旅店老板家
Now she lives with an innkeeper man and his wife,
我付抚养费 这有什么不对?
and I pay for the child. What's the matter with that?
到头来她只会招灾惹祸
At the end of the day she'll be nothing but trouble,
一人惹祸 大家遭殃
and there's trouble for all when there's trouble for one!
我们辛勤劳碌
While we're earning our daily bread,
她却到处揩油
she's the one with her hands in the butter.
必须赶走这荡妇 否则我们都会堕落
You must send the slut away or we're all gonna end in the gutter.
到头来得由我们替她受罪
And it's us who'll have to pay at the end of the day!
我早该猜到这母狗有本事
I might have known the bitch could bite!
早该猜到这是个狐狸精
I might have known the cat had claws!
我早该猜到你的小秘密
I might have guessed your little secret!
是啊 贞女芳汀
Ah, yes! The virtuous Fantine.
出淤泥而不染
Who keeps herself so pure and clean.
这里的风波都是你兴风作浪
You'd be the cause, I had no doubt of any trouble hereabout.
白日里装得清纯可爱 黑夜里倒会投怀送抱
You play a virgin in the light, but need no urging in the night!
她勾搭了男人 还拿你当笑料
She's been laughing at you while she's having her men!
她就是个祸水 没完没了
She'll be nothing but trouble again and again!
今天就得解雇她      今天解雇她
You must sack her today!        Sack the girl today!
好啦 姑娘
Right, my girl.
开路吧
On your way!
I Dreamed a Dream - Fantine
曾经 人们和颜悦色
There was a time when men were kind,
他们声音温柔
When their voices were soft,
话语讨人欢喜
and their words inviting.
曾经 爱情无所禁忌
There was a time when love was blind,
世界是一首歌
and the world was a song,
歌声动人心弦
and the song was exciting!
可是何时
There was a time,
一切都已不再
then it all went wrong.
时光荏苒 我流连梦境
I dreamed a dream in time gone by,
心比天高 人生充满希望
when hope was high and life worth living.
我梦见爱情永不消逝
I dreamed that love would never die.
我梦见上帝慈爱宽恕
I dreamed that God would be forgiving.
那时我多么年轻 多么无畏
Then I was young and unafraid.
挥霍梦想 从不设防
And dreams were made and used and wasted.
不必付出什么代价
There was no ransom to be paid,
无歌不唱 无酒不尝
no song unsung, no wine untasted.
然而猛兽在黑夜来袭
But the tigers come at night
细语如霹雳轰然炸响
with their voices soft as thunder.
活生生撕碎了希望
as they tear your hope apart,
把美梦全变成
As they turn your dream
羞辱
to shame.
他睡在我身边一个夏天
He slept a summer by my side.
他给我带来无穷惊喜
He filled my days with endless wonder.
他随手摘去了我的纯真
He took my childhood in his stride,
当秋天到来 他却消失不见
but he was gone when autumn came.
我仍然梦想他会回到我身边
And still I dream he'll come to me,
我们还能相守一生
that we will live the years together.
但总有些梦无法成真
But there are dreams that cannot be.
总有些风暴会把人摧毁
And there are storms we cannot weather.
我曾梦见的那种人生
I had a dream my life would be,
与这人间地狱截然不同
so different from this hell I'm living,
何曾想过命运如此无常
so different now from what it seemed!
现实却残忍击碎了
Now life has killed the dream
我的梦
I dreamed.

Fantine's Arrest - Javert, Fantine, Bamatabois, Valjean
马上告诉我怎么回事
Tell me quickly what's the story.
何时何地 有谁目击?
Who saw what, and why, and where?
让他从头说来 让他向沙威交待
Let him give a full description! Let him answer to Javert!
在这妓女和毒蛇的巢穴 让目击者来说
In this nest of whores and vipers, let one speak who saw it all.
谁朝这个正派人出的手
Who laid hands on this good man here?
你们在吵什么?
What's the substance of this brawl?
沙威 你能信吗? 我只是从公园走过
Javert, would you believe it? I was crossing from the park
这妓女就袭击了我 你看她抓伤的印子
when this prostitute attacked me. You can see she left her mark!
她要付出代价的 只需您说清案情
She will answer for her actions when you make a full report.
您大可放心 先生 一定让她上法庭
You may rest assured, monsieur. That she will answer to the court.
我还有个孩子要养活
There's a child who sorely needs me.
行行好 先生 她才这么点高
Please, monsieur, she's but that high.
主啊 不能开开眼么? 我去坐牢她就死路一条
Holy God, is there no mercy? If I go to jail she'll die!
这种借口我天天听 听了足有二十年
I have heard such protestations every day for 20 years.
省省你的狡辩吧
Let's have no more explanations.
哭天抢地也是白费
Save your breath and save your tears.
诚实工作 正派谋生 这才是上帝赞赏的正道
Honest work, just reward. That's the way to please the Lord.
容我说一句 沙威 我相信这女人的话
A moment of your time, Javert. I do believe this woman's tale.

可是市长先生
But, Monsieur Mayor.
你已尽了职责 放了她吧 她需要医生而非牢房
You've done your duty, let her be. She needs a doctor not a jail.
可是市长先生      这可能么?
But, Monsieur Mayor.  Can this be?
她会落到何地 这无亲无故的孩子?
Where will she end? This child without a friend?
我似乎认得你
I've seen your face before,
告诉我怎样才能帮你
show me some way to help you.
你怎会如此不幸
How have you come to grief
落到这步田地
in such a place as this.
先生 您别嘲笑我了吧
Monsieur, don't mock me now, I pray!
失去尊严我已经够痛苦了
It's hard enough I've lost my pride!
你让你的工头把我赶走
You let your foreman send me away.
对 你就在那里 无动于衷
Yes, you were there and turned aside.
我从没有犯过错
I never did no wrong.
这真是我造的孽么
Is it true, what I've done...
我女儿就快死了
My daughter's close to dying.
伤害一个无辜的灵魂?
...to an innocent soul?
如果天上真有天主      如果我早知道...
If there's a God above...    Had I only known then.
他会让我替她死去
...he'd let me die instead.
以主之名 这件事由我来担当
In his name my task has just begun
我会负责到底
I will see it done.
可是市长先生
But, Monsieur Mayor!
送她去医院
Take her to the hospital!
可是市长先生
But, Monsieur Mayor!
我会负责到底
I will see it done!

Who am I
这是真的么?
Can this be true?
我不敢相信我的眼睛
I don't believe what I see!
您这么大年纪 还如此强壮
A man your age to be as strong as you are!
似曾相识啊
A memory stirs!
您让我想起一个人
You make me think of a man
多年以前
from years ago.
有个人从假释中脱逃
A man who broke his parole,
他消失了
he disappeared.
请原谅 先生 我冒犯了
Forgive me, sir! I would not dare.
不要紧 想到什么就说
Say what you must. Don't leave it there.
我只知道一个人可以做到您刚才这样
I have only known one other who can do what you have done.
他犯了罪 曾被绳之以法 这十年他都在逃亡
He's a convict from the chain gang. He's been 10 years on the run.
可他不能永远逃脱 我们找到了他的巢穴
But he couldn't run forever! We have found his hideaway.
他刚被重新逮捕 今天就要上法庭了
And he's just been re-arrested, and he comes to court today.
当然 如今他矢口否认 罪犯都是这样
Well, of course, he now denies it. You'd expect that of a con.
但他不能永远逍遥法外 哪怕他是冉阿让
But he couldn't run forever! No, not even Jean Valjean!
你说他矢口否认
You say this man denies it all,
对此莫名其妙 毫无悔改之意
and gives no sign of understanding or repentance.
你说他就要上法庭
You say this man is going to trial,
肯定会被送回去服刑
and that he's sure to be returned to serve his sentence.

这么说 你真能肯定
Come to that, can you be sure
我不是你要找的人?
that I am not your man?
我认识这贼人多年
I have known the thief for ages,
天涯海角追捕他
tracked him down through thick and thin.
最可靠的是 我认得他身上的烙印
And to make the matter certain, there's the brand upon his skin.
他会招认 他会坦白
He will bend, he will break.
这次他别想再漏网
This time there is no mistake!
他们胡乱一看就把那人当成了我
He thought that man was me without a second glance.
他找到的那陌生人可能是我的救星
This stranger he has found, this man could be my chance.
我何必要救他 何必要纠正这过错?
Why should I save his hide? Why should I right this wrong?
我已经走了这么远 挣扎了这么久
When I have come so far and struggled for so long?
如果我坦白 我会被定罪
If I speak, I am condemned.
如果我沉默
If I stay silent,
我会遭天谴
I am damned!
好几百号工人 全靠我谋生
I am the master of hundreds of workers, they all look to me.
我怎能抛弃他们?
Can I abandon them?
如果我身陷囹圄 他们怎么活?
How will they live if I am not free?
如果我坦白 他们会受罪
If I speak, they are condemned.
如果我沉默 我会遭天谴
If I stay silent, I am damned.
我是谁?
Who am I?
我怎能把这个人打为奴隶?
Can I condemn this man to slavery?
假装感受不到他的痛苦?
Pretend I do not feel his agony?
一个和我相似的无辜人
This innocent who wears my face,
要替我上庭受审
who goes to judgement in my place.
我是谁?
Who am I?
我能一辈子隐藏自己么?
Can I conceal myself for evermore?
假装我不曾是从前的我
Pretend I'm not the man I was before?
隐姓埋名 至死都不敢公诸于世?
And must my name until I die, be no more than an alibi?
必须撒谎吗 我岂再有颜面再面对同胞?
Must I lie? How can I ever face my fellow men?
我岂有颜面再面对自己?
How can I ever face myself again?
我的灵魂归天主所有 多年以前就作过约定
My soul belongs to God, I know I made that bargain long ago.
当希望泯灭时 他给我希望
He gave me hope when hope was gone.
他给我继续前行的力量
He gave me strength to journey on.
我是谁?
Who am I?
我是谁?
Who am I?
我是冉阿让
I'm Jean Valjean!
那么沙威 你所见不虚
And so, Javert, you see it's true.
这个人并不比你更有罪
This man bears no more guilt than you.
我是谁?
Who am I?
我是24601
24601!

You've played the day away,

天就快要黑了

到我这里来
Come to me,
珂赛特 日光已淡去
Cosette, the light is fading.
你听 冬日寒风在呼啸
Don't you hear the winter wind is crying?
黑暗总是不期而至
There's a darkness which comes without a warning,
但我会给你唱摇篮曲 唤你迎接清晨
but I will sing you lullabies and wake you in the morning.
芳汀 我们的时间不多了
Oh, Fantine, our time is running out.
但是芳汀 我以生命向你起誓
But, Fantine, I swear this on my life.
看哪 先生 孩子们在那玩耍
Look, monsieur, where all the children play!
安心吧
Be at peace!
安心休息吧
Be at peace ever more.
我的珂赛特...      会由我来保护
My Cosette...        Shall live in my protection.
带走她吧      你的孩子将心满意足
Take her now!        Your child will want for nothing.
好先生 您是天主派来的使者
Good monsieur! You come from God in heaven.
只要我还在 没人能伤害珂赛特

握住我的手
Take my hand,
夜晚愈来愈寒冷
the night grows ever colder.
我会给你温暖
Then I will keep you warm.
带走我的孩子
Take my child,
我把她交给你照顾
I give her to your keeping.
为她遮风蔽雨
Take shelter from the storm.
看在上帝份上 请等我睡着了再走

告诉珂赛特 我爱她
And tell Cosette I love her,
等我醒来就去看她
and I'll see her when I wake.

The Confrontation - Valjean, Javert 
冉阿让 我们终于又见面了
Valjean, at last we see each other plain!
市长先生 你要戴上另一副锁链了
Monsieur le Mayor, you'll wear a different chain!
在你开口之前 沙威
Before you say another word, Javert,
在你再锁我去当奴隶之前
before you chain me up like a slave again.
听我说 我有件事必须做
Listen to me! There is something I must do.
这女人留下了一个受苦的孩子
This woman leaves behind a suffering child,
只有我能解救
there is none but me who can intercede.
发发慈悲 我只求三天
In mercy's name, three days are all I need.
等我回来 我会兑现诺言 等我回来
Then I'll return, I pledge my word. Then I'll return.
你以为我疯了吧 我追踪你那么多年
You must think me mad! I've hunted you across the years.
你这样的人永不会变 你这样的人
Men like you can never change! A man such as you!
哪怕你不相信也好      我这样的人永不会变
Believe of me what you will.        Men like me can never change.
我有责任 我起过誓      你这样的人永不会变
There is a duty I'm sworn to do.        Men like you can never change.
我的人生你一无所知      不 24601号
You know nothing of my life.         No, 24601!
我的罪只是偷块面包
All I did was steal some bread.
我的职责是维护法律      你完全不懂这世界
My duty is to the law.        You know nothing of the world.
你已没有权利
You have no rights!
你宁愿看到我死去      跟我走 24601号
You would sooner see me dead.         Come with me, 24601!
但我要眼见正义得伸      如今情势已经倒转
But not before I see this justice done!        Now the wheel has turned around,
冉阿让已经一钱不值
Jean Valjean is nothing now.

我警告你 沙威      你还敢跟我谈犯罪
I am warning you, Javert.       Dare you talk to me of crime.
我比你强壮得多      你的代价必须偿还
I'm the stronger man by far!        And the price you had to pay.
我还有几分力量      人人生而有原罪
There is power in me yet!         Every man is born in sin.
我还远远没有爆发      人人都要为自己选择
My race is not yet run!         Every man must choose his way.
我警告你 沙威     你根本不了解沙威
I am warning you, Javert.        You know nothing of Javert!
没有什么我不敢      我就生在监狱里
There is nothing I won't dare!        I was born inside a jail,
若我现在要杀你      我就生在你这种渣滓中间
If I have to kill you here,        I was born with scum like you.
我也不会手软      我也出身贫贱
I'll do what must be done.        I am from the gutter, too.
我今晚向你发誓
And this I swear to you tonight,
你已经无可遁形
There is no place for you to hide,
你的孩子会由我照顾
Your child will live within my care.
不管你藏在哪
wherever you may hide away.
我会将她抚养成人
And I will raise her to the light.
我向你发誓
I swear to you!
我都会在那里
I will be there!

不 先生 你搞错了
No, monsieur, you don't know what you do!
你认得我 你认得我 跟你一样是骗子
You know me, you know me! I'm a con, just like you
警察来了 躲起来 快跑
It's the police! Disappear! Run for it!
是沙威
It's Javert!
广场上又一场骚乱 又一阵恶臭扑鼻
Another brawl in the square! Another stink in the air!
有没有目击者? 让他向沙威答话
Was there a witness to this? Well, let him speak to Javert!
先生 街巷不安宁 这些害虫等着瞧
Monsieur, the streets are not safe, but let these vermin beware!
我们总要伸张正义
We'll see that justice is done!
看这一块石头下爬出的魑魅魍魉
Look upon this fine collection crawled from underneath a stone.
蛇虫鼠蚁 向人敲骨吸髓
This swarm of worms and maggots could have picked you to the bone!
我认得那个人 我知道他的名字 营生
I know this man over here. I know his name and his trade.
只要你作证 先生 我就将他绳之以法
And on your witness, monsieur. I'll see him suitably paid.
可这位先生去哪了 他为何要逃跑?
But where's the gentleman gone? And why on earth did he run?
你可放跑了大鱼啦
You will have a job to catch him!
他才是你该抓的人
He's the one you should arrest!
他可不是什么良民
No more bourgeois when you scratch him
看他胸前的烙印
than that brand upon his chest!
莫不是某个逃犯 又浮出了水面?
Could it be he's some old jailbird that the tide now washes in?
一听我名字便逃走 皮肤上烫着烙印
Heard my name and started running, had the brand upon his skin.
还有他身边的女孩
And the girl who stood beside him,
也随他逃遁无踪
when I turned they both had gone.
他莫不是我追捕的人 他莫不是冉阿让?
Could he be the man I've hunted? Could it be he's Jean Valjean?
既然没了受害者
In the absence of a victim.
亲爱的警官 我先撤啦?
Dear Inspector, may I go?
等你抓到他 别忘记
And remember when you've nicked him,
是我给你提的醒
it was me wot told you so!
让那老人继续逃窜
Let the old man keep on running,
且看我捉拿他归案
I will run him off his feet!
各人都好自为之 散了吧 这些垃圾
Everyone about your business! Clear this garbage off the street!

Stars - Javert 
在那儿 茫茫黑夜中
There, out in the darkness,
一个逃犯在流窜
a fugitive running.
背叛了上帝
Fallen from God,
辜负了天恩
fallen from grace.

上帝 请为我见证
God, be my witness!
哪怕穷尽一生 我也要让他无处遁形
I never shall yield till we come face to face!
我也要让他无处遁形
Till we come face to face!
他在暗处轻车熟路
He knows his way in the dark.
我跟随天主 堂堂正正
Mine is the way of the Lord.
走正义之路的人风雨兼程
Those who follow the path of the righteous
奖赏终获怀中
shall have their reward.
如果他们坠落 如路西弗堕入地狱
And if they fall, as Lucifer fell.
烈焰蚀心 利剑折磨
The flame! The sword!
繁星 布满了苍穹
Stars in your multitudes!
数不胜数
Scarce to be counted.
点亮黑暗
Filling the darkness
以光明和秩序
with order and light.
人间的卫士啊
You are the sentinels.
沉默又坚定
Silent and sure!
守望着黑夜 守望着黑夜
Keeping watch in the night. Keeping watch in the night!
你深知你在天空的使命
You know your place in the sky.
你执着向前 心无旁骛
You hold your course and your aim!
四季变换 你随之轮转
And each in your season returns and returns,
道路始终如一
And is always the same.
如果你坠落 如路西弗堕入地狱
And if you fall, as Lucifer fell,
你也会烈焰焚身
you fall in flames!
天理昭彰 书载言传
And so it must be, for so it is written

铭刻在天堂的通路上
on the doorway to Paradise,
动摇者和堕落者
that those who falter and those who fall
必得付出代价
must pay the price!
主啊 让我找到他
Lord, let me find him,
将他置于牢笼之下
that I may see him safe behind bars!
我会不眠不休 直到那天
I will never rest till then!
我向你起誓
This I swear!
以这繁星之名起誓
This I swear by the stars!

Marius and Éponine（少词）

The ABC Cafe- Enjolras, Marius, Students 
圣米歇尔广场 缪尚咖啡馆
时机近了
The time is near!
时不我待 它奋张着每一根血脉
So near, it's stirring the blood in their veins!
可要当心
And yet beware!
别让烈酒冲昏了脑袋
Don't let the wine go to your brains.
我们要对抗的军队绝非善类
For the army we fight is a dangerous foe,
兵力火力我们都不可匹敌
with the men and the arms that we never can match.
就算打他们像打苍蝇一样以逸待劳
It is easy to sit here and swat them like flies,
国民自卫军会更难应付
but the National Guard will be harder to catch.
我们还缺一个信号 用来召集人民
We need a sign to rally the people,
武装起来 一致对外
to call them to arms! To bring them in line!
马吕斯 你来晚了      今天是怎么了
Marius, you're late.        What's wrong today?
你像是撞见了幽灵一样
You look as if you've seen a ghost!
喝口酒 快些讲
Some wine, and say what's going on!
你说幽灵 就算幽灵吧 对我来说她就像个幽灵
A ghost you say? A ghost may-be. She was just like a ghost to me!
突然出现 又突然消失
One minute there, then she was gone!
我真是瞠目又结舌
I am agog! I am aghast!
马吕斯终于坠入了爱河?
Is Marius in love at last?
从没见他这么支支吾吾
I have never heard him "ooh" and "ah".
你们研究怎么打胜仗 他像唐璜奔赴情场
You talk of battles to be won. And here he comes like Don Juan.
这可比歌剧还好看啊
It is better than an opera!
这是我们选择命运的时刻
It is time for us all to decide who we are!
我们浴血奋战 难道只为一场浪漫剧?
Do we fight for the right to a night at the opera now?
你可曾问过自己 愿付出什么代价
Have you asked of yourselves what's the price you might pay?
还是把它当成一场富家子的玩乐?
Is this simply a game for rich young boys to play?
世界的颜色 每天都在变幻
The colours of the world are changing day by day.
红 是愤怒的热血沸腾
Red, the blood of angry men!
黑 是被抛弃的蒙昧世界
Black, the dark of ages past!
红 是即将破晓的天空
Red, a world about to dawn!
黑 是长夜将尽的洪钟
Black, the night that ends at last!
如果今晚你也在那 也许能了解我的感受
Had you been there tonight, you might know how it feels.
那让人窒息的 突如其来的悸动
To be struck to the bone in a moment of breathless delight.
如果今晚你也在那 也许还能明白
Had you been there tonight, you might also have known.
世界怎样为一道光芒天翻地覆
How the world may be changed with just one burst of light.
对错颠倒 是非迷离
And what was right seems wrong, and what was wrong seems right!
红      是我的灵魂在燃烧
Red!        I feel my soul on fire!
黑      没有她 我的世界也被掏空
Black!        My world if she's not there!
红      是渴望的色彩
Red!        The colour of desire!
黑      是被绝望包裹的冰冷
Black!       The colour of despair!
马吕斯 你不是孩子了
Marius, you're no longer a child.
我不怀疑你是认真的
I do not doubt you mean it well.
可更崇高的使命正在召唤
But now there is a higher call!
谁理会你的儿女情长?
Who cares about your lonely soul?
我们有了更宏伟的目标
We strive towards a larger goal.
在它面前 我们的性命都微不足道
Our little lives don't count at all!
红 是愤怒的热血沸腾
Red, the blood of angry men!
黑 是被抛弃的蒙昧世界
Black, the dark of ages past!
红 是即将破晓的天空
Red, a world about to dawn!
黑 是长夜将尽的洪钟
Black, the night that ends at last!
大家听我说
Listen, everybody!
拉马克将军死了
General Lamarque is dead!
拉马克死了
Lamarque is dead!
拉马克 他的死是天定的时机
Lamarque, his death is the hour of fate.
人民的将军
The people's man.
他的死正是我们等待的信号
His death is the sign we await!
葬礼那天人们会对他歌颂赞美
On his funeral day they will honour his name.
叛逆如火花闪耀在眼中
With the light of rebellion ablaze in their eyes.
我们就让这星星之火燎原
From their candles of grief we will kindle our flame!
在拉马克的坟墓上筑起街垒
On the tomb of Lamarque shall our barricade rise!
时机到了
The time is here!
让我们给它激烈无畏的欢迎
Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer!
让我们走上街头抗争 以笃定的心
Let us take to the streets with no doubt in our hearts,
欢呼一声
But a jubilant shout!
人们会一个个倒向我们
They will come one and all!
人人都会响应我们的呼声
They will come when we call!

Do You Hear the People Sing?

听啊 人民在歌唱 群情激奋 歌声嘹亮
Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men?
那是一个民族呼唤 砸断锁链得解放
It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again!
当你心跳激昂回荡 和着那战鼓声声响
When the beating of your heart, echoes the beating of the drums.
我们会浴火重生 迎来明日曙光
There is a life about to start when tomorrow comes!
谁要加入我们的征程
Will you join in our crusade?
坚定站在我身旁?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
跨过硝烟 越过街垒 新世界就在前方
Beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see?
快来并肩作战 实现自由理想
Then join in the fight that will give you the right to be free!
听啊 人民在歌唱 群情激奋 歌声嘹亮
Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men?
那是一个民族呼唤 砸断锁链得解放
It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again!
当你心跳激昂回荡 和着那战鼓声声响
When the beating of your heart, echoes the beating of the drums!
我们会浴火重生 迎来明日曙光
There is a life about to start when tomorrow comes!
你可愿意献出一切 高举战旗向前方?
Will you give all you can give, so that our banner may advance?
将生死置之度外
Some will fall and some will live
不枉为人活一场
Will you stand up and take your chance?
就让烈士的鲜血浇灌自由之花开放
The blood of the martyrs will water the meadows of France!
听啊 人民在歌唱 群情激奋 歌声嘹亮
Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men?
那是一个民族呼唤 砸断锁链得解放
It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again!
当你心跳激昂回荡 和着那战鼓声声响
When the beating of your heart, echoes the beating of the drums.
我们会浴火重生 迎来明日曙光
There is a life about to start when tomorrow comes!
圣日耳曼郊区 卜吕梅街

In My Life
好奇怪 我的人生似乎终于开始
How strange, this feeling that my life's begun at last.
这种变化 人们真能这么快就相爱吗?
This change! Can people really fall in love so fast?
你这是怎么了 珂赛特
What's the matter with you, Cosette?
是一个人走得太久了吗?
Have you been too much on your own?
太多看不透的事
So many things unclear,
太多懵懂的未知
so many things unknown.
在我一生中
In my life,
有太多模棱两可的问题和答案
there are so many questions and answers that somehow seem wrong.
在我一生中
In my life,
有时我会在寂静中听到
there are times when I catch in the silence,
一首遥远的歌
the sigh of a far away song.
歌里唱着我憧憬的那个世界
And it sings of a world that I long to see.
遥不可及 又近在咫尺等我靠近
Out of reach, just a whisper away, waiting for me!
他知道我的存在吗 我怎么知道他是真的?
Does he know I'm alive? Do I know if he's real?
他是否见我所见 是否与我心心相印?
Did he see what I see? Does he feel what I feel?
在我一生中
In my life,
我终于不再孤单 我一生挚爱已如此之近
I'm no longer alone now, the love in my life is so near.
快找到我吧
Find me now!
我就在这里
Find me here!
亲爱的珂赛特 你这孤独的孩子
Dear Cosette, you're such a lonely child!
多么忧伤 满怀心事
How pensive! How sad you seem to me!
请相信如果我能 我会让你的每时每刻充满意义
Believe me, were it within my power, I'd fill each passing hour.
你的时光 多么孤寂
How quiet it must be, I can see,
只有我陪伴着你
with only me for company.
我总是好奇 却又记不起
There's so little I know that I'm longing to know,
我孩提时的经历
of the child that I was in a time long ago.
您总是不愿提起往事
There's so little you say of the life you have known.
为什么您孑然一身 为什么我们离群索居
Why you keep to yourself? Why we're always alone?
无人知晓 深不见底
So dark, so dark and deep.
您严守的秘密
The secrets that you keep.
在我一生中
In my life,
我不再是个孩子 我渴望您所知的真相
I'm no longer a child and I yearn for the truth that you know
多年前 多年前的真相
Of the years, years ago!
你会知道的
You will learn!
真相由上帝揭示 时机自有天意
Truth is given by God to us all in our time, in our turn!
M：
在我一生中
In my life,
她突然登场 像天使的音乐 太阳的光亮
she has burst like the music of angels! The light of the sun!
我的人生似乎戛然而止 旧日结束
And my life seems to stop as if something is over,
又未能写下新章
and something has scarcely begun!
爱潘妮 我的朋友 是你把我带到了这儿
Eponine, you're the friend who has brought me here.
多谢你 我才得到主的恩宠 找到了天堂
Thanks to you, I am one with the God and heaven is near!
让我在自由的新世界里飞翔
And I soar through a world that is new, that is free!
他说的每个字都刺在我心上
Every word that he says is a dagger in me!
在我一生中
In my life,
从没有人能像他一样
there's been no one like him anywhere.
追随他 天涯海角
Anywhere, where he is.
只要他开口 我就归他所有
If he asked, I'd be his!
在我一生中
In my life,
有个人触动了我的生命
there is someone who touches my life.
就要到来
Waiting near!
静静等待
Waiting here!

A Heart Full Of Love
一颗心溢满了爱
A heart full of love!
爱让我开口歌唱
A heart full of song!
我的世界一片混乱
I'm doing everything all wrong!
上帝啊 这怎么可以
Oh, God, for shame!
我竟然不知道你的名字
I do not even know your name,
亲爱的小姐啊
dear mademoiselle,
你愿意讲吗 你会告诉我吗?
won't you say? Will you tell?
一颗心溢满了爱
A heart full of love!
无畏无惧也不后悔
No fear, no regret!
我叫马吕斯·彭眉胥
My name is Marius Pontmercy.
我叫珂赛特
And mine's Cosette.
珂赛特 我不知该说什么
Cosette! I don't know what to say.
那就什么也不要讲
Then make no sound.
不思量
I am lost!
自难忘
I am found!
一颗心满是阳光
A heart full of light!
夜晚比白昼还明亮
A night bright as day!
请你千万别离我而去
And you must never go away,
珂赛特 珂赛特
Cosette, Cosette!
命运之链将我们牢牢牵扯
This is a chain we'll never break.
我在做梦吗?
Do I dream?
我是清醒的      一颗心溢满了爱
I'm awake.        A heart full of love!
他从来不属于我      一颗心装满了你
He was never mine to lose!        A heart full of you!
何必为不可能的事懊悔      只需一眼 我就知道
Why regret what could not be?        A single look and then I knew!
我也知道      这些他永不会对我说
I knew it, too!        These are words he'll never say.
不会对我说      从今天开始
Not to me.        From today...
不会对我      这不是梦
Not to me!        Not for me.
每一天都是
Every day!
因为这不是梦      他的心溢满了爱
For it isn't a dream.        His heart full of love.
终究不是      他永不会
Not a dream...         He will never...
不是梦      懂我的心
after all!        feel this way!
The Attack on Rue Plumet
这就是他的窝 我见过这老狐狸
This is his lair! I've seen the old fox around!
神龙见首不见尾 不声不响
He keeps himself to himself, he's staying close to the ground.
我闻到了钱的味道
I smell profit here!
十年前 他买走了珂赛特
Ten years ago, he came and paid for Cosette.
我把她低价出手 今天才是讨债的时候
I let her go for a song. It's time we settled the debt.
这次绝不会便宜了他
This'll cost him dear!
我才不管你想找谁算帐
What do I care who you should rob?
把活儿干完 我那份给我
Gimme my share! Finish the job!
闭上你的嘴 给我帮点忙
You shut your mouth! You'll get what's yours!
这是谁?
What have we here?
哪来的小贱人
Who is this hussy?
这是你家爱潘妮 你连你女儿都不认识了吗?
It's your brat Eponine! Don't you know your own kid?
她干嘛跟着你?
Why's she hanging about you?
爱潘妮 回家去 这没你什么事
Eponine, get on home! You're not needed in this.
我们人手够了
We're enough here without you!
我认识这房子 告诉你 这里没你要的东西
I know this house, I tell you! There's nothing here for you!
只有个老人和他女儿
Just the old man and the girl,
普普通通过日子
they live ordinary lives.
少插手 吃了豹子胆了
Don't interfere! You've got some gall!
当心点 小妞 少跟我啰嗦
Take care, young Miss! You've got a lot to say!
她手软了      这也难免的
She's going soft!        Happens to all!
回家去 爱潘妮 回家去 别碍事
Go home, 'Ponine! Go home, you're in the way!
我要喊人了 我要警告他们
I'm gonna scream, I'm gonna warn them here!
你敢吱一声 我让你后悔一整年
One little scream and you'll regret it for a year!
去下水道 从地下逃走
Make for the sewers! Get underground!
我来对付她 别耽搁了
Leave her to me! Don't wait around!
等着瞧 死丫头 有你后悔的
You wait my girl! You'll rue this night!
看我不让你喊个痛快
I'll make you scream! You'll scream alright!
是你的叫声让他们仓皇逃走
It was your cry sent them away,
爱潘妮 又一次做了救星
once more 'Ponine, saving the day!
亲爱的珂赛特 我的朋友爱潘妮
Dearest Cosette, my friend 'Ponine,
把我带到了你身边 给我指了路
brought me to you! Showed me the way!
有人要来了 我们快躲起来
Someone is near! Let's not be seen!
有人要来了
Somebody's here!
上帝啊 珂赛特 我听见黑暗中有人大叫
My God, Cosette! I heard a cry in the dark,
我听见街上人们愤怒的吼声
I heard the shout of angry voices in the street.
您听见的是我的叫声 爸爸
That was my cry you heard, Papa.
我不知道他们要做什么
I was afraid of what they'd do.
他们听到我喊叫就逃走了
They ran away when they heard my cry.
珂赛特 我的孩子 你该怎么办?
Cosette, my child. What will become of you?
我看见墙外有三个人
Three men I saw beyond the wall,
三个人在阴影里逃窜
Three men in shadow moving fast!
这是给我们的警告
This is a warning to us all!
这些是旧日的阴影
These are the shadows of the past!
一定是沙威 他还是找到了我的藏身之处
Must be Javert! He's found my cover at last.
我得趁他们回来前带珂赛特走
I've got to get Cosette away before they return!
得远远逃离这纠缠不休的阴影
We must get away from shadows that will never let us be.
明天去加莱 然后漂洋过海
Tomorrow to Calais. And then a ship across the sea.
快准备上路 珂赛特 什么都别说
Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave and say no more.
明天我们远走高飞
Tomorrow we'll away!
快 珂赛特 我们又要斩断过去
Hurry, Cosette! It's time to close another door!
开始新生活
And live another day!

One Day More
只待明日
One day more!
新的一天 新的命运
Another day, another destiny.
耗尽漫漫一生 走在这荆棘路上
This never-ending road to Calvary.
这些人知道我过去的罪
These men who seem to know my crime,
终究不会放过我
will surely come a second time.
只待明日      我的人生自今日才有意义
One day more!        I did not live until today.
若与你分离 我怎能活下去?
How can I live when we are parted?
只待明日
One day more!
明日我们就要天各一方
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away.
我的世界有了你才开始
And yet with you my world has started!
明日我依旧孑然一身
One more day all on my own!
我们还能相见吗?
Will we ever meet again?
明日他依旧不闻不问
One more day with him not caring.
我注定要与你在一起
I was born to be with you!
我本该拥有怎样的人生
What a life I might have known.
我发誓为你永守忠贞
And I swear I will be true!
为他守候 他却看不见
But he never saw me there!
只待明日 暴风雨就要来临
One more day before the storm!
我该追随她离开?
Do I follow where she goes?
筑起街垒 争取自由
At the barricades of freedom!
还是与兄弟们站在一起?
Shall I join my brothers there?
我们的队伍严阵以待
When our ranks begin to form,
我敢不敢留下来?
Do I stay, and do I dare?
你可愿意与我并肩作战?
will you take your place with me?
就是现在 时候到了
The time is now! The day is here!
只待明日
One day more!
明日革命已蓄势待发 我们会把它扼杀在萌芽
One more day to revolution. We will nip it in the bud.
我们会管教这群小男生
We'll be ready for these schoolboys.
让他们尝尝流血的滋味      只待明日
They will wet themselves with blood!        One day more!
看他们残杀 等他们倒下
Watch 'em run amuck. Catch 'em as they fall.
天上掉馅饼 人人都有份
Never know your luck when there's a free-for-all.
这里刮点皮 那里揩点油
Here a little dip. There a little touch.
反正他们死到临头了 才不介意呢
Most of them are goners so they won't miss much!
明日就是崭新的开始 高举起自由的旗帜
One day to a new beginning! Raise the flag of freedom high
每个人都是王国之主 每个人都是王国之主
Every man will be a king! Every man will be a king!
新世界只属于胜利者
There's a new world for the winning!
新世界等待我们征服
There's a new world to be won!
听啊 人民在歌唱
Do you hear the people sing?

明日我们将天各一方      明日就是最终审判日
Tomorrow we'll be far away.        Tomorrow is the judgement day.
明日就将揭晓 天意如何安排
Tomorrow we'll discover what our God in heaven has in store.
只待黎明
One more dawn!
只待破晓
One more day!
只待明日
One day more!
第二幕

1832年6月5日 蒙德都街 街垒
At the Barricade
我们就在这些砖石上筑起街垒
Here upon these stones we will build our barricade,
在城市的心脏占领一席之地
in the heart of the city we claim as our own.
每个人坚守岗位 不必畏惧
Each man to his duty and don't be afraid!
等等 我需要关于敌方兵力的探报
Wait! I will need a report on the strength of the foe.
我能查到 我对他们了如指掌
I can find out the truth! I know their ways!
我曾服过兵役 与他们一同作战
Fought their wars, served my time,
在我年轻时
in the days of my youth.
喂 小男孩 这是谁?
Hey, little boy, what's this I see?
天啊 爱潘妮 你来干什么
God, eponine, the things you do!
我知道不该来 可我宁愿和你在一起
I know this is no place for me, still I would rather be with you!
趁骚乱爆发前快走
Get out before the trouble starts!
爱潘妮 中枪不是好玩的
Get out, 'Ponine, you might get shot!
我让你担心了 真的
I got you worried now, I have!
看来你还挺喜欢我呢
That shows you like me quite a lot.
有件事你能帮忙 有件事非你不可
There is a way that you can help. You are the answer to a prayer!
请把这封信交给珂赛特
Please take this letter to Cosette.
上帝保佑她还没离开
and pray to God that she's still there!
你一无所知
Little you know!
你毫不在乎
Little you care!
我有封信 先生
I have a letter, monsieur.
要交给您女儿珂赛特
It's addressed to your daughter Cosette.
是瓦勒路上街垒里一个男孩写的 先生
It's from a boy at the barricade, sir, in the Rue de Valette.
把信给我 男孩
Give me that letter here, my boy.
他说要面交珂赛特
He said to give it to Cosette.
我向你保证
You have my word that
我女儿会知道信的内容
my daughter will know what this letter contains.
告诉那年轻人 她明天会读到
Tell the young man she will read it tomorrow.
这是你的酬劳
and here's for your pains.
小心回去 避人耳目
Go careful now, stay out of sight.
今夜街面上危机四伏
There's danger in the streets tonight.
最亲爱的珂赛特
Dearest Cosette,
你已印上我的灵魂 转瞬又将远去
You have entered my soul and soon you will be gone.
真的只是一天前你我才相遇
Can it be only a day since we met
世界才刚刚重生?
and the world was reborn?
如果我在战斗中死去 这就是我的告别
If I should fall in the battle to come, let this be my goodbye.
如今我知道了你...也爱着我
Now that I know that you love me as well
生命更难以捐弃
it is harder to die.
我祈求天主让我回家 回到你身边
I pray that God will bring me home to be with you.
为你的马吕斯祷告吧
Pray for your Marius.
他也为你祷告
He prays for you.

On My Own
我又是孑然一身了 无依无靠 无处倾诉
And now I'm all alone again, nowhere to turn, no one to go to.

没有家也没有朋友 没有一个人能打招呼
Without a home, without a friend, without a face to say hello to.
夜幕降临
And now the night is near,
我才可以假装他就在身边
now I can make believe he's here.
有时当夜色笼罩 我独自走上街头
Sometimes I walk alone at night when everybody else is sleeping.
想着他就感到欢喜 此刻有他做我的伴侣
I think of him and then I'm happy with the company I'm keeping.
城市沉沉睡去
The city goes to bed
我才能躲进自己
and I can live inside
幻想的天地
my head!
一个人
On my own,
假装他在我身旁
Pretending he's beside me.
孤单单 他陪我走到天亮
All alone, I walk with him till morning.
他不在 我却能感到他的拥抱
Without him, I feel his arms around me.
迷路时只需闭上双眼
And when I lose my way, I close my eyes
他就会找到我
and he has found me.
雨朦胧
In the rain,
地面银光闪烁
the pavement shines like silver.
看街灯 映河水如烟如梦
All the lights are misty in the river.
黑暗中 树枝间缀满星辰
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight.
我仿佛看见我俩相伴 直到永远
And all I see is him and me forever and forever!
我知道 这不过是我的想象
And I know it's only in my mind.
那些话都是我自言自语
That I'm talking to myself and not to him,
也知道 他只会视而不见
And although I know that he is blind.
但仍觉得 我们还有希望
Still I say there's a way for us.
我爱他 但当黑夜结束
I love him. But when the night is over,
他消失 河又变回了平凡的河
he is gone, the river's just a river.
没有他 我周围的一切都变了
Without him, the world around me changes.
到处都是光秃秃的树木
The trees are bare and everywhere,
街上满是陌生的身影
the streets are full of strangers.
我爱他 但我也日渐明了
I love him. But every day I'm learning -
这一生 我不过在欺骗自己
All my life, I've only been pretending.
没有我 他的世界依然如故
Without me, his world will go on turning.
那里满是我从未体会过的幸福
A world that's full of happiness that I have never known.
我爱他
I love him!
我爱他
I love him!
我爱他
I love him!
却只是
But only
一厢情愿
on my own!

Javert's Arrival 
他回来了
He's back!
听着朋友们 我说到做到
Listen, my friends I have done as I said.
我到过他们的阵地 清点过他们的人数
I have been to their lines, I have counted each man.
我将知无不言
I will tell what I can.
要小心 敌方人多势众
Better be warned, they have armies to spare
我们十分危险
and our danger is real.
只可智取 以妙计图之
We will need all our cunning to bring them to heel!

要有信心
Have faith!
既然你知道他们的动向 我们就先发制人
If you know what their movements are we'll spoil their game.
打仗的方法千变万化
There are ways that our people can fight.
我们会四两拨千斤
We shall overcome their power!
我听到了他们的计划 今晚不会进攻
I overheard their plans. There will be no attack tonight.
他们想先耗尽我们补给 再一举拿下
They intend to starve us out before they start a proper fight.
他们会集中兵力 主攻右翼
Concentrate their force, hit us from the right.

Little People
骗子
Liar!
晚上好 亲爱的警探 多美好的夜晚
Good evening, dear Inspector. Lovely evening, my dear!
我认识他 朋友们 他是警探沙威
I know this man, my friends. His name's Inspector Javert!
他的话一个字也别信 全是一派胡言
So don't believe a word he says, 'cause none of it's true.
这只能证明 小家伙有大用处
This only goes to show what little people can do!
太棒了 小伽弗洛什 你真是好样的
Bravo, little Gavroche! You're the top of the class!
现在怎么处置这条狡猾的蛇?
So what are we gonna do with this snake in the grass?
把他带走 关到酒馆里
Take this man and throw him in the tavern in there!
你的命运由人民决定 沙威警探
The people will decide your fate, Inspector Javert!
要杀要留 随你们这帮小男生高兴
Shoot me now or shoot me later - Every schoolboy to his sport!
叛国贼都死有余辜 我不认你们的人民法庭
Death to each and every traitor! I renounce your people's court!
把他押下去
Take this man, bring him through.
我们还有正事
There is work we have to do.
有个男孩爬过街垒来了
There's a boy climbing the barricade!

A Little Fall of Rain 
老天 你干什么呀 爱潘妮 你不会害怕吗?
Good God! What are you doing? 'Ponine! Have you no fear?
你见到我的心上人了吗 怎么又回来了?
Have you seen my beloved? Why have you come back here?
我照你吩咐送去了信 在门口见到了他父亲
Took the letter, like you said. I met her father at the door.
他说他会转交 我好像站不住了
He said he would give it. I don't think I can stand any more.

如果我能 我要让你长命百岁
You will live 100 years if I could show you how.

你会抱紧我
And you will keep me close.
我会在你的怀中入睡
I'll sleep in your embrace at last.
天赐甘霖 将你带到我身边
The rain that brings you here is heaven blessed!
云开雨霁 我安然离去
The skies begin to clear and I'm at rest.
你在身边 触手可及
A breath away from where you are.
我终于回家了
I've come home from so far.
别伤心 马吕斯先生      安睡吧 亲爱的艾潘妮
don't you fret, Monsieur Marius.        Hushabye, dear eponine.
我已经不痛了      你不会再痛苦

Bring Him Home 
主在上
God on high,
听我祈祷

请让他歇息

给他庇佑

带他回家
Bring him home!
带他回家
Bring him home!
带他回家
Bring him home!
他就像我的儿子
He's like the son I might have known,
如果上天曾赐我儿子
if God had granted me a son.
四季轮回交替
The summers die one by one,
时光日夜飞逝
how soon they fly on and on?
而我已年迈
And I am old,
不久于人世
and will be gone.

The Final Battle
街垒后的人们听着
You at the barricade listen to this!
巴黎人民尚在梦乡
The people of Paris sleep in their beds!
你们没有希望 毫无胜算
You have no chance! No chance at all!
何必抛掷自己的生命?
Why throw your lives away?
死也要拼死一搏 让敌人为我们殉葬
Let us die facing our foes! Make them bleed while we can!
让敌人付出代价
Make them pay through the nose!
血债血偿
Make them pay for every man!
我们自有后来人
Let others rise
将自由带给这片土地
to take our place until the earth is free!

巴黎 下水道中
The Sewers
是你 沙威 就知道你不会久等
It's you, Javert. I knew you wouldn't wait too long.
忠诚的公仆 又坚守岗位了
The faithful servant at his post once more!
这人是无辜的 他需要治伤
This man's done no wrong. He needs a doctor's care!
我警告你我不会放弃 我不会动摇
I warned you I would not give in! I won't be swayed!

一小时后我任你处置
Another hour yet, and then I'm yours.
将你我的恩怨了结
And all our debts are paid!
又来了 好个仁人君子 还满嘴正义
The man of mercy comes again, and talks of justice!
行行好 时间不多了
Come, time is running short!
低头看 沙威 他几乎就要断气
Look down, Javert! He's standing in his grave!
带他走 冉阿让
Take him, Valjean!
趁我还没改变主意
Before I change my mind!
我等着你 24601号
I will be waiting, 24601!

Javert's Suicide 
他是谁 是什么恶魔?
Who is this man? What sort of devil is he?
用陷阱把我抓住 却放了我?
To have me caught in a trap, and choose to let me go free?
我的命运一度握于他手
It was his hour at last to put a seal on my fate!
抹掉过去 杀掉我灭口
Wipe out the past and wash me clean off the slate!
只需刀尖轻轻一挑
All it would take was a flick of his knife!
复仇近在眼前 他却放了我一条生路
Vengeance was his and he gave me back my life!
可恶 我的命竟由一个贼来施舍
Damned if I live in the debt of a thief!
可恶 我竟在追捕的最后屈服
Damned if I yield at the end of the chase!
我代表法律 法律不能被嘲笑
I am the law, and the law is not mocked!
他的施舍我弃如粪土
I'll spit his pity right back in his face!
他是他 我是我 霄壤之别
There is nothing on earth that we share!
沙威与冉阿让 不共戴天
It is either Valjean or Javert!
如今我怎能让此人
How can I now allow this man

将我握于掌心?
to hold dominion over me?
他曾在我追捕下亡命天涯
This desperate man whom I have hunted.
此时却给我生命 给我自由
He gave me my life! He gave me freedom!
我本应死于他手
I should have perished by his hand,
那是他的权利
it was his right.
死去也是我的权利
It was my right to die as well.
我却活下来 活在地狱里
Instead, I live, but live in hell.
我思绪一片混乱
And my thoughts fly apart.
这个人能不能相信?
Can this man be believed?
他的罪过难道该宽恕?
Shall his sins be forgiven?
他的刑罚难道该缓刑?
Shall his crimes be reprieved?
难道一定要我开始怀疑
And must I now begin to doubt,
多年来坚定的自己?
who never doubted all these years?
我本心如铁石 却不由颤抖
My heart is stone and still it trembles.
我所知的世界 迷失在阴影中
The world I have known is lost in shadow.
他究竟来自天堂还是地狱? 
Is he from heaven or from hell? 
他是否知道
And does he know,
今天他给我生路
that granting me my life today,
同样是取我性命
this man has killed me even so?
我伸手求援 却颓然坠落
I am reaching, but I fall.
群星也阴沉冰冷
And the stars are black and cold.
我凝视着这虚空 无法掌控 空无如梦
As I stare into the void of a world that cannot hold.
我要逃离这个世界 这个冉阿让的世界
I'll escape now from that world, from the world of Jean Valjean.
我没有退路
There is nowhere I can turn.
也无法前行
There is no way to go on!

Turning（词不对）
你可看见他们冲向战场?
Did you see them going off to fight?
街垒后的孩子们 没能看见黎明
Children of the barricade that didn't last the night.
一群学生仔 从没拿过枪
They were school boys, never held a gun.
盼着硝烟散尽 新世界如太阳般升起
Fighting for a new world that would rise up like the sun.
现在仗打完了 新世界在哪里?
Where's that new world now the fighting's done?
谁会叫醒他们?      谁也不会
Who will wake them?        No one ever will.
没人曾告诉他们 一个艳阳天也会杀人
No one ever told them that a summer day can kill.
老套的故事 眼泪哭给谁看?
Same old story what's the use of tears?
无人垂怜 祈祷又给谁听?
What's the use of praying if there's nobody who hears?

Empty Chairs at Empty Tables – Marius
有一种悲伤 无法言说
There's a grief that can't be spoken.
有一种痛苦 永无止歇
There's a pain goes on and on.
空桌伴着空椅子
Empty chairs at empty tables,
我的朋友们已永远离去
now my friends are dead and gone.
在这里他们曾指点江山
Here they talked of revolution.
在这里他们将革命之火点燃
Here it was they lit the flame.
在这里他们歌颂明天
Here they sang about tomorrow.
而明天却不再到来
And tomorrow never came.
就在这角落的桌边
From the table in the corner,
他们看见新世界诞生
they could see a world reborn.
他们站起身来 陈词慷慨
And they rose with voices ringing,
声音仍回响在我耳边
and I can hear them now!
他们唱过的歌声
The very words that they had sung
成了彼此最后的绝响
became their last communion
在那黎明时分 孤独的街垒上
on this lonely barricade at dawn.
啊 朋友们 朋友们 请原谅我
Oh, my friends, my friends, forgive me
你们走了 我却苟活
that I live and you are gone.
有一种悲伤 无法言说
There's a grief that can't be spoken.
有一种痛苦 永无止歇
There's a pain goes on and on.
熟悉的面容 恍惚就在窗边
Phantom faces at the window!
熟悉的身影 恍惚映在地面
Phantom shadows on the floor!
空桌伴着空椅子
Empty chairs at empty tables,
我的朋友再也不会相聚
where my friends will meet no more.
啊 我的朋友们 不要问我
Oh, my friends, my friends, don't ask me -
你们的牺牲究竟是为了什么
What your sacrifice was for?
空桌伴着空椅子
Empty chairs at empty tables,
我的朋友们再也不会
Where my friends will meet
在此相聚
no more.

Not a dream...        This I give you...
不是梦      送给你们
...after all...        this day.

先生 我终生也忘不了今天
Monsieur, this is a day I never can forget.
该怎么感激您给了我珂赛特?
Is gratitude enough for giving me Cosette?
您要和我们住在一起 就从今天
Your home shall be with us and not a day shall pass.

别说了 我的孩子

There's something now that must be done.
从前有个男人 名叫冉阿让
There lived a man whose name was Jean Valjean.
他偷了一块面包 救他小外甥的命
He stole some bread to save his sister's son.
他服苦役19个春秋
For 19 winters served his time.
用汗水洗刷了罪孽
In sweat he washed away his crime!
多年以前
Years ago,
他从假释中逃脱 开始新生活
he broke parole and lived a life apart.
他怎能告诉珂赛特这些 伤透她的心?

这都是为了珂赛特

如果他被捕 她也会声名扫地
If he is caught, she is disgraced.

and from this day he must be gone!
我是谁?

But 500 francs surely wouldn't come amiss.
上帝呀 有话就说
In God's name, say what you have to say!
先交钱
But first you pay!
我清清楚楚看到
What I saw, clear as light,
那夜冉阿让就在下水道
Jean Valjean in the sewers that night.
像扛包袱一样扛着具尸体
Had this corpse on his back, hanging there like a bloody great sack.
我就在那里 毫不畏惧
I was there, never fear!
还捡了这个小纪念品
And even found me this fine souvenir!
我认得 这是我的
I know this! This was mine!
这是上天揭示的线索
This is surely some heavenly sign!
还有件事 您听好了
One thing more, mark this well,
那正是街垒陷落之夜
it was the night that the barricade fell!
是真的 我猜对了
Then it's true! Then I'm right!
冉阿让就是我的救命恩人
Jean Valjean was my saviour that night!
至于你 这个也拿去
As for you, take this, too!
愿天主赦免我们的行为
God forgive us the things that we do!
来吧 亲爱的 来吧 珂赛特
Come, my love, come, Cosette.
今天还有另一桩喜事
This day's blessings are not over yet!
这不是个乐子? 这不是桩美事?
Ain't it a laugh? Ain't it a treat?
与上等人一起吃饭喝酒？
Hob-nobbin' here among the elite?
这里一位王子 那儿一个犹太人
Here comes a prince. There goes a Jew.
这人是个同性恋 但你又能怎样?
This one's a queer. But what can you do?
巴黎在我脚下
Paris at my feet!
巴黎在尘埃中
Paris in the dust!
而我在这里 与上等人一起吃饭
And here's me, breaking bread with the upper crust!
盛宴中的乞丐 舞王之王
Beggar at the feast! Master of the dance!
手疾眼快 顺手牵羊
Life is easy pickings if you grab your chance.
现在那些 守法良民
Everywhere you go, law-abiding folk,
表面上体体面面 实际上入不敷出
doing what is decent but they're mostly broke!
周日礼拜 祈求上天恩赏
Singing to the Lord on Sundays, praying for the gifts he'll send.
受惠却的是我们
But we're the ones who take it.
笑到最后的人
We're the ones who make it in the end!
看那些混蛋跳舞 他们迟早摔跤
Watch the buggers dance! Watch them till they drop!
脑子灵光 才能屹立不倒
Keep your wits about you and you stand on top!
无论谁当家 我们总有油水可捞
Masters of the land! Always get our share!
街垒空了 而我们仍在
Clear away the barricades and we're still there!
不管刮什么风 总能闻到钱的味道
We know where the wind is blowing! Money is the stuff we smell!
等我们富比王侯
And when we're rich as Croesus,
上帝啊 咱们地狱里见
Jesus! Won't we see you all in hell?

Valjean's Death
在黑暗中我独自等待
Alone I wait in the shadows,
辗转反侧 难以成眠
I count the hours till I can sleep.
我梦到珂赛特站在我身边
I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by,
得知我死后失声哭泣
it made her weep to know I die.
日暮时分 我独自一人
Alone at the end of the day,
为这婚礼默默祈祷
Upon this wedding night I pray.
主啊 引领这些孩子 到你的怀中
Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace,
沐浴荣光
and show them grace.
主在上
God on high,
听我祈祷
hear my prayer.

带我走
Take me now,
受您恩典
to thy care.
您在何处
Where you are,
让我跟随
let me be.
带我走吧
Take me now!
带我远去
Take me there!
带我回家
Bring me home!
带我回家
Bring me home!
先生 祝福您
Monsieur, I bless your name.
我准备好了 芳汀
I am ready, Fantine.
先生 放下您的重担
Monsieur, lay down your burden.
在我人生的终点
At the end of my days.
您用爱抚育了我的孩子
You raised my child in love.
她是我最美的记忆
She's the best of my life.
上帝与您同在
And you will be with God.
爸爸 爸爸 我不明白
Papa, papa, I do not understand!
你怎么了 他们说你走了
Are you alright? They said you'd gone away!
珂赛特 我的孩子 你原谅我了吗?
Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven now?
感谢上帝 我终于盼到了这天
Thank God, thank God! I lived to see this day!
是我要求您宽恕 我这不懂事的傻瓜
It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool!
请您原谅我这忘恩负义之人
It's you who must forgive a thankless man!
多亏您 我才活到今天
It's thanks to you that I am living.
我的生命也愿奉献给您
And again I lay down my life at your feet.
珂赛特 你父亲是个圣人
Cosette, your father is a saint!
当我奄奄一息躺在街垒 是他救了我
When they wounded me, he took me from the barricade,
像抱一个孩子 带我回家 来到你身边
carried like a babe and brought me home to you!
现在你们都在
Now you are here,
回到了我身边
again beside me.
我可以平静地离去
Now I can die in peace,
此刻我已受主恩典
for now my life is blessed.
你会活着的 爸爸 你会活下去
You will live, papa, you're going to live!
不要 不要急着说再见
It's too soon, too soon to say goodbye!
好 珂赛特不许我死去
Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die!
我听你的
I'll obey.
我会尽力
I will try.
在这张纸上 有我最后的告解
On this page, I write my last confession.
等我终于安息再读吧
Read it well, when I, at last, am sleeping.
这故事里的人们一直爱着你
It's the story of those who always loved you.
你的母亲为你献出生命 然后将你托付给我
Your mother gave her life for you then gave you to my keeping.
跟我来
Come with me,
到没有枷锁的地方
where chains will never bind you.
您所有的苦难 终于 终于已到尽头
All your grief at last, at last, behind you.
天上的主
Lord in heaven,
慈悲地垂怜他吧
look down on him in mercy.
宽恕我的罪过 领我进入你的荣光
Forgive me all my trespasses and take me to your glory!
牵我的手
Take my hand,
我来领你得到拯救
I lead you to salvation.
接受我的爱
Take my love,
因为爱是永恒
for love is everlasting.
并且牢记
And remember
那千古流传的真理
the truth that once was spoken,
凡爱他人者 就得见上帝
to love another person is to see the face of God.

Finale: Do You Hear the People Sing
听啊 人们在歌唱 黑夜幽谷 歌声回荡
Do you hear the people sing, lost in the valley of the night?
那是一个民族欢呼 翻山越岭见光芒
It is the music of a people who are climbing to the light.
人间困苦都尝遍 还未泯灭一线希望
For the wretched of the earth, there is a flame that never dies.
哪怕是长夜漆黑 也将升起太阳
Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.
他们将重生得自由 主的园中鲜花绽放
We will live again in freedom in the garden of the Lord.
他们将携手驾起犁铧
We will walk behind the plough-share.
把刀剑丢一旁
We will put away the sword.
将枷锁全砸碎 人人都得奖赏
The chain will be broken and all men will have their reward.
谁要加入我们的征程
Will you join in our crusade?
坚定站在我身旁?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
跨过硝烟 越过街垒 新世界就在前方
Somewhere beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see?
听啊 人们在歌唱 听远处战鼓声声响
Do you hear the people sing? Say, do you hear the distant drums?
他们会捧出未来 且看明日曙光
It is the future that they bring when tomorrow comes!
谁要加入我们的征程
Will you join in our crusade?
坚定站在我身旁?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
跨过硝烟 越过街垒 新世界就在前方
Somewhere beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see?
听啊 人们在高唱 听远处战鼓声声响
Do you hear the people sing? Say, do you hear the distant drums?
他们会捧出未来 且看明日曙光

Tomorrow comes!
